I am a JavaScript developer with a passion for architecting and building front-end web applications. I have spent the last two years leading work on highly interactive single page apps and multi-million pound websites.

I have production experience in a wide range of technologies and love to explore new ones whenever I get the chance. Most of all, I still get a kick out of turning ideas into beautifully functional, well architected products using lean, modular code and a text editor.
