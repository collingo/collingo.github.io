JavaScript developer with a passion for architecting and building client-side web applications. Several years wide ranging experience, from leading large front-end builds to getting elbow deep in test driven code on highly-interactive, data-driven apps.

Constant exploration has given me production experience in a wide range of technologies and I am always keen to try more. Most of all, I still get a kick out of turning ideas into beautifully functional, well architected products using lean, modular code and a text editor.
